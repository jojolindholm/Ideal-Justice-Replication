This repository contains data and scripts neccesary to replicate the study contained in our paper 'The Ideal Justice:: Who Are Selected to Serve and What Does It Say About Swedish High Courts?'. The underlying data is split between two files. The first one, 'judges_info', contains information about on which high court all 453 Swedish Justices (1789–2021) served and the decade when they were first appointed to a high court. The second one, 'judges_seq', contains those Justices' professional legal background leading up to the first appointment represented as sequences of a length of 100 % where each state represents 1 % of the total time. Each of these files are inlcuded in two file formats, as RData-files for easy use in R and as csv-files for non-R software. The respository also includes a copy of the R-script used to conduct the sequence analysis and produce the figures included in the paper.
